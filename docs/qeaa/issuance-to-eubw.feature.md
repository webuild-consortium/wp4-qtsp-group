# Feature: QEAA issuance to EUBW

The QTSP issues QEAA to the EUBW.
The QTSP does not necessarily rely on the EUBW for identification of the user.

Issuance of non-qualified EAA is out of scope for the QTSP group.
However, just like non-qualified EAA, the QEAA is expected to meet the interoperability requirements agreed in WP4.

## Scenario: Wallet-initiated

The EUBW requests a known QTSP to issue a particular QEAA.
